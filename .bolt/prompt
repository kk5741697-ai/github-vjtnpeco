You don’t want a complex interface or random extra inputs; you want a dummy layout that is exactly like iLovePDF / iLoveIMG, with the same style of UX/UI flow:

Step 1 (Upload Interface) → Already handled by bolt.new.

Step 2 (Tool Interface) → Needs:

Left side → canvas/preview area (PDF pages preview, or image preview).

Right side (fixed sidebar) → options/actions (split, crop, resize, rotate, etc).

No footer → keep layout full-height, clean, responsive.

Right sidebar fixed → works perfectly on mobile (collapses below).

Modern, simple like iLovePDF/iLoveIMG → not over-complicated.

Here’s a dummy Next.js 14 + Tailwind layout component you can drop in (components/ToolLayout.tsx).
This will give you the exact layout skeleton with no build errors:

// Example what i want the layout

"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function ToolLayout({
title = "PDF Splitter",
children,
}: {
title?: string;
children?: React.ReactNode;
}) {
const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(true);

return (
<div className="flex h-screen w-full overflow-hidden bg-gray-50">
{/* Left Canvas / Preview /}
<div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center overflow-auto">
<div className="max-w-4xl w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6">
{/ Example preview (dummy content) */}
<div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-gray-500">
<p className="text-lg font-medium">{title} Preview</p>
<div className="mt-4 border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 rounded-lg w-60 h-80 flex items-center justify-center">
<span className="text-sm">PDF / Image Page Preview</span>
</div>
{children}
</div>
</div>
</div>


  {/* Right Sidebar (Fixed Options) */}
  <div className="w-80 bg-white border-l shadow-lg flex flex-col fixed right-0 top-0 h-screen p-6">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">{title} Options</h2>

    {/* Example Options */}
    <div className="space-y-4 flex-1 overflow-auto">
      <div>
        <label className="block text-sm font-medium mb-1">Range Mode</label>
        <div className="flex gap-2">
          <button className="px-3 py-1 border rounded bg-red-500 text-white">
            Custom ranges
          </button>
          <button className="px-3 py-1 border rounded">Fixed ranges</button>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label className="block text-sm font-medium mb-1">Page Range</label>
        <div className="flex gap-2">
          <input
            type="number"
            className="w-20 border rounded px-2 py-1"
            placeholder="From"
          />
          <input
            type="number"
            className="w-20 border rounded px-2 py-1"
            placeholder="To"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <button className="mt-6 w-full py-3 rounded-lg bg-red-600 text-white font-semibold shadow hover:bg-red-700">
        Split PDF
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
);
}

-----

still getting much more difficulties and has much more problems in image and pdf tools
1. pdf - split mode by default pages (that's will ensure selected pages will be split and download
2. page select not working
3. pdf real page preview with view the real page content as like ilovepdf.com iloveimg.com, not dummy page preview
4. download button will need be appear below the `split pdf` or `other tools process button`
5. download will be like this if single file download single. if more that 1, it will be download as zip not single by single.
6. compress file size are not showing real, suppose downloaded file size is 400kb it will showing the original file size `1987 × 3000 1472.6 KB → 1472.6 KB`
7. image crop not working from left plane by mouse or from mobile devices.
8. not responsive in mobile or other devices.
9. when cropping or doing other things from left plane ui, no need to give input options again eg: (Position X (px) Position Y (px)) etc.
10. suppose visited to `/convert-to-jpg` `/convert-to-png` etc it will automatically set the jpg or png or etc as expected. also can be change the output as currently now has.
11. convert of images are not working as expected. eg: input image was png output selected bmp or other ext format, it still downloading the original ext format.
12. also many more problems.
13. all features said Left plane canvas capabilities said `actions, operations, crop, zoom, resize, reorder, etc as recommended also need by you` are not implemented/not working.
